# TOP CHEF

## NODE SIDE
Open the folder node-project </br>
Open the console
Run <code>node server.js</code>
Go to localhost:8081 on your navigator to run the server, that starts the scraping
I made the code scrap only the 5 first pages of Michelin to make it faster (it was really slow to scrap all the pages)
It creates the output file with all the restaurants scraped

## REACT SIDE
Open the foler react-app
Run npm-start
Go to localhost:3000 on your navigator to show the react website
You can search a restaurant by name, writing a sub-string contained by the name (it is not case-sensitive, or accent-sensitive, try different things)
You can also search the restaurants by their number of stars
