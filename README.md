# TOP CHEF

## NODE SIDE
Open the folder node-project </br>
Open the console </br>
Run <code>node server.js</code> </br>
Go to localhost:8081 on your navigator to run the server, that starts the scraping </br>
I made the code scrap only the 5 first pages of Michelin to make it faster (it was really slow to scrap all the pages) </br>
It creates the output file with all the restaurants scraped </br>

## REACT SIDE
Open the foler react-app </br>
Run npm-start </br>
Go to localhost:3000 on your navigator to show the react website </br>
You can search a restaurant by name, writing a sub-string contained by the name (it is not case-sensitive, or accent-sensitive, try different things) </br>
You can also search the restaurants by their number of stars </br>
